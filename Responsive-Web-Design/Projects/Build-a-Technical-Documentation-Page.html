                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to
                describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML
                (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS
                describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper,
                in speech, or on other media.
              </p>

              <p>
                CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is
                standardized across Web browsers according to W3C
                specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of
                CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the
                versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard
                about CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or
                a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS without a version number.
              </p>
              <p>
                After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased
                significantly and the progress on different CSS modules started
                to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and
                release recommendations separately per module. Instead of
                versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a
                snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and
                individual modules progress. CSS modules now have version
                numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5.

                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web
                pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing
                of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add
                animations and other decorative features. This module provides a
                gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the
                basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you
                can start using it to add styling to HTML.
              </p>

                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking
                web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article
                explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also
                covers some key terms about the language.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and
                how it is used to mark up documents. These documents will be
                readable in a web browser. Headings will look larger than
                regular text, paragraphs break onto a new line and have space
                between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish
                them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the
                browser's default styles — very basic styles — that the browser
                applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically
                readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author
                of the page.
              </p>
              <p>
                As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying
                how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid
                out, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                A document is usually a text file structured using a markup
                language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may
                also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
              </p>
              <p>
                Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form
                usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or
                Edge, are designed to present documents visually, for example,
                on a computer screen, projector, or printer.
              </p>
              <p>
                CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for
                example, for changing the color and size of headings and links.
                It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a
                single column of text into a layout with a main content area and
                a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for
                effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this
                paragraph for specific examples.

            <article>
              <p>
                CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by
                specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular
                elements or groups of elements on your web page.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your
                page to be shown as large red text. The following code shows a
                very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described
                above:
              </p>
              <code> h1 { color: red; font-size: 5em; } </code>
              <code> h2 { color: blue; font-size: 4em; } </code>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector. This
                  selects the HTML element that we are going to style.
                </li>
                <li>In this case, we are styling level one headings (h1). .</li>
                <li>We then have a set of curly braces { }.</li>
                <li>
                  Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take
                  the form of property and value pairs. We specify the property
                  (color in the above example) before the colon, and we specify
                  the value of the property after the colon (red in this
                  example).
                </li>
                <li>
                  This example contains two declarations, one for color and the
                  other for font-size. Each pair specifies a property of the
                  element(s) we are selecting (h1 in this case), then a value
                  that we'd like to give the property.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on
                which property is being specified. In our example, we have the
                color property, which can take various color values. We also
                have the font-size property. This property can take various size
                units as a value.
              </p>
              <p>
                A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after
                the other.
              </p>
              <code> h1 { color: red; font-size: 5em; }</code>
              <code> p { color: black; } </code>
              <code> span { background-color: green; } </code>
              <p>
                You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others
                you will need to look up. The individual property pages on MDN
                give you a quick way to look up properties and their values when
                you forget or when you want to know what else you can use as a
                value.

              <p>
                As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the
                language is broken down into modules. You'll see reference to
                these modules as you explore MDN. Many of the documentation
                pages are organized around a particular module. For example, you
                could take a look at the MDN reference to the Backgrounds and
                Borders module to find out what its purpose is and the
                properties and features it contains. In that module, you will
                also find a link to Specifications that defines the technology
                (also see the section below).
              </p>
              <p>
                At this stage, you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is
                structured; however, it can make it easier to find information
                if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely
                to be found among other similar things, and is therefore,
                probably in the same specification.
              </p>
              <p>
                For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and
                Borders module — you might think that it makes logical sense for
                the background-color and border-color properties to be defined
                in this module. And you'd be right.
